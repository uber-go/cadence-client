	// or workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, "name") to get a Channel that contains data sent to this workflow by a call to
	// SignalWorkflow (e.g. on the Client, or similar methods like SignalExternalWorkflow or SignalChildWorkflow).
	//
	// Both NewChannel and NewBufferedChannel have "Named" constructors as well.
	// These names will be visible in stack-trace queries, so they can help with debugging, but they do not otherwise
	// impact behavior at all, and are not recorded anywhere (so you can change them without versioning your code).
	//
	// Also note that channels created by NewChannel and NewBufferedChannel do not do any serialization or
	// deserialization - you will receive whatever value was sent, and non-(de)serializable values like function
	// references and interfaces are fine, the same as using a normal Go channel.
	//
	// Signal channels, however, contain whatever bytes were sent to your workflow, and the values must be decoded into
	// the output value.  By default, this means that Receive(ctx, &out) will use json.Unmarshal(data, &out), but this
	// can be overridden at a worker level (worker.Options) or at a context level (workflow.WithDataConverter(ctx, dc)).
	//
	// You are able to send values to your own signal channels, and these values will behave the same as they do in
	// normal channels (i.e. they will not be (de)serialized).  However, doing so is not generally recommended, as
	// mixing the value types can increase the risk that you fail to read a value, causing values to be lost.  See
	// Receive for more details about that behavior.
	Channel interface {
		// Receive blocks until it receives a value, and then assigns the received value to the provided pointer.
		// It returns false when the Channel is closed and all data has already been consumed from the Channel, in the
		// same way as Go channel reads work, but the assignment only occurs if there was a value in the Channel.
		//
		// This is technically equivalent to:
		//  received, ok := <- aChannel:
		//  if ok {
		//  	*valuePtr = received
		//  }
		//
		// But if your output values are zero values, this is equivalent to a normal channel read:
		//  value, ok <- aChannel
		//
		// valuePtr must be assignable, and will be used to assign (for in-memory data in regular channels) or decode
		// (for signal channels) the data in the channel.
		//
		// If decoding or assigning fails:
		// - an error will be logged
		// - the value will be dropped from the channel
		// - Receive will automatically try again
		// - This will continue until a successful value is found, or the channel is emptied and it resumes blocking.
		//   Closed channels with no values will always succeed, but they will not change valuePtr.
		//
		// Go would normally prevent incorrect-type failures like this at compile time, but the same cannot be done
		// here.  If you need to "try" to assign to multiple things, similar to a Future you can use:
		// - for signal channels, a []byte pointer.  This will give you the raw data that Cadence received, and no
		//   decoding will be attempted, so you can try it yourself.

		// When f is invoked, the data (or closed state) remains untouched in the channel, so
		// you need to `c.Receive(ctx, &out)` (or `c.ReceiveAsync(&out)`) to remove and decode the value.
		// Failure to do this is not an error - the value will simply remain in the channel until a future
		// Receive retrieves it.
		//
		// The `ok` argument will match what a call to c.Receive would return (on a successful read), so it
		// may be used to check for closed + empty channels without needing to try to read from the channel.
		// See Channel.Receive for additional details about reading from channels.
		AddReceive(c Channel, f func(c Channel, ok bool)) Selector
		// AddSend waits to send a value to a channel.

		//
		// There is no direct equivalent in a native Go select statement.
		// It was added because Futures are common in Cadence code, and some patterns are much simpler with it.
		//
		// Each call to AddFuture will invoke its f at most one time, regardless of how many times Select is called.
		// This means, for a Future that is (or will be) ready:
		// - Adding the Future once, then calling Select twice, will invoke the callback once with the first Select
		//   call, and then wait for other Selector conditions in the second Select call (or block forever if there are
		//   no other eligible conditions).
		// - Adding the same Future twice, then calling Select twice, will invoke each callback once.
		// - Adding the same Future to two different Selectors, then calling Select once on each Selector, will invoke
		//   each Selector's callback once.
		//
		// Therefore, with a Future "f" that is or will become ready, this is an infinite loop that will consume as much
		// CPU as possible:
		//  for {
		//  	workflow.NewSelector(ctx).AddFuture(f, func(f workflow.Future){}).Select(ctx)
		//  }
		// While this will loop once, and then wait idle forever:
		//  s := workflow.NewSelector(ctx).AddFuture(f, func(f workflow.Future){})
		//  for {
		//  	s.Select(ctx)
		//  }
		AddFuture(future Future, f func(f Future)) Selector
		// AddDefault adds a default branch to the selector.
		// f is invoked immediately when none of the other conditions (AddReceive, AddSend, AddFuture) are met for a
		// Select call.
		//
		// This is equivalent to a `default:` case.
		//
		// Note that this applies to each Select call.  If you create a Selector with only one AddDefault, and then call
		// Select on it twice, f will be invoked twice.
		AddDefault(f func())
		// Select waits for one of the added conditions to be met and invokes the callback as described above.
		// If no condition is met, Select will block until one or more are available, then one callback will be invoked.
		// If no condition is ever met, Select will block forever.
		//
		// Note that Select does not return an error, and does not stop waiting if its Context is canceled.
		// This mimics a native Go select statement, which has no way to be interrupted except for its listed cases.
		//
		// If you wish to stop Selecting when the Context is canceled, use AddReceive with the Context's Done() channel,
		// in the same way as you would use a `case <- ctx.Done():` in a Go select statement.  E.g.:
		//  cancelled := false
		//  s := workflow.NewSelector(ctx)
		//  s.AddFuture(f, func(f workflow.Future) {}) // assume this is never ready
		//  s.AddReceive(ctx.Done(), func(c workflow.Channel, more bool) {

// DefaultVersion is a version returned by GetVersion for code that wasn't versioned before
const DefaultVersion Version = -1

// CadenceChangeVersion is used as search attributes key to find workflows with specific change version.
const CadenceChangeVersion = "CadenceChangeVersion"

// GetVersion is used to safely perform backwards incompatible changes to workflow definitions.
// It is not allowed to update workflow code while there are workflows running as it is going to break
// determinism. The solution is to have both old code that is used to replay existing workflows
// as well as the new one that is used when it is executed for the first time.
// GetVersion returns maxSupported version when is executed for the first time. This version is recorded into the
// workflow history as a marker event. Even if maxSupported version is changed the version that was recorded is
// returned on replay. DefaultVersion constant contains version of code that wasn't versioned before.
// For example initially workflow has the following code:
//
//	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, foo).Get(ctx, nil)
//
// it should be updated to
//
//	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, bar).Get(ctx, nil)
//
// The backwards compatible way to execute the update is
//
//	v :=  GetVersion(ctx, "fooChange", DefaultVersion, 1)
//	if v  == DefaultVersion {
//	    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, foo).Get(ctx, nil)
//	} else {
//	    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, bar).Get(ctx, nil)
//	}
//
// Then bar has to be changed to baz:
//
//	v :=  GetVersion(ctx, "fooChange", DefaultVersion, 2)
//	if v  == DefaultVersion {
//	    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, foo).Get(ctx, nil)
//	} else if v == 1 {
//	    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, bar).Get(ctx, nil)
//	} else {
//	    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, baz).Get(ctx, nil)
//	}
//
// Later when there are no workflow executions running DefaultVersion the correspondent branch can be removed:
//
//	v :=  GetVersion(ctx, "fooChange", 1, 2)
//	if v == 1 {
//	    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, bar).Get(ctx, nil)
//	} else {
//	    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, baz).Get(ctx, nil)
//	}
//
// It is recommended to keep the GetVersion() call even if single branch is left:
//
//	GetVersion(ctx, "fooChange", 2, 2)
//	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, baz).Get(ctx, nil)
//
// The reason to keep it is: 1) it ensures that if there is older version execution still running, it will fail here
// and not proceed; 2) if you ever need to make more changes for “fooChange”, for example change activity from baz to qux,
// you just need to update the maxVersion from 2 to 3.
//
// Note that, you only need to preserve the first call to GetVersion() for each changeID. All subsequent call to GetVersion()
// with same changeID are safe to remove. However, if you really want to get rid of the first GetVersion() call as well,
// you can do so, but you need to make sure: 1) all older version executions are completed; 2) you can no longer use “fooChange”
// as changeID. If you ever need to make changes to that same part like change from baz to qux, you would need to use a
// different changeID like “fooChange-fix2”, and start minVersion from DefaultVersion again. The code would looks like:
//
//	v := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, "fooChange-fix2", workflow.DefaultVersion, 1)
//	if v == workflow.DefaultVersion {
//	  err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, baz, data).Get(ctx, nil)
//	} else {
//	  err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, qux, data).Get(ctx, nil)
//	}
