// ErrResultPending is returned from activity's implementation to indicate the activity is not completed when
// activity method returns.  The Activity needs to be completed by [go.uber.org/cadence/client.Client.CompleteActivity]
// separately.
//
// For example, if an activity requires human interaction (like approving an expense report), the activity could push
// its [Info.TaskToken] to an external system, and return [ErrResultPending].  Later on, a human can approve it, and the
// system can use the associated token with [go.uber.org/cadence/client.Client.CompleteActivity] to finish the
// still-"running" activity.
//
// Caution: since using this frequently implies "long" timeouts, but there is no actually-running activity function
// that can use [go.uber.org/cadence/client.Client.RecordActivityHeartbeat], activity-worker losses prior to recording
// the [Info.TaskToken] in an external system may not be noticed until the "long" timeout occurs.  This can be resolved
// by having another system call RecordActivityHeartbeat while that external action is running, but there is currently
// no way to mitigate this issue without these heartbeats.
//
// If you cannot heartbeat and cannot tolerate this kind of delayed-activity-loss detection, consider emulating a long
// activity via a signal channel instead: you can start a short-lived activity and wait for a "saved to external system"
// signal, retrying as necessary, and then wait for an "external system finished" signal containing the final result.
